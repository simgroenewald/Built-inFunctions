# Built-inFunctions
Software Engineering Boot Camp - Task 23

Compulsory Task
Follow these steps:
● Create a new Python file in this folder called “Binary.py”
● Write a program that can convert a binary number to a decimal number.
● A binary number is a number that is made up entirely of 0s and 1s (e.g
101101). You can represent any amount you would like using binary.
● Ask the user to enter a binary number and convert that number to a
decimal number.
● You can visit the following website to find out how to convert from binary
to decimal:
http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/how-binary-to-decimal.htm
● Print out the decimal value of the number.
● Remember to make use of the built-in functions found in the math
module as well as lists (remember to import the math module into your
program!).
